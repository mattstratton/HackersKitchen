Matty's Pancakes
========================

This makes enough pancakes for one adult and three kids; modify as to what makes sense for you. It's not super accurate or scientific.

Ingredients
-----------
2 eggs, separated
2 cups flour
1 1/2 cups milk
2 Tablespoons sour cream
4 Tablespoons oil
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 Tablespoons sugar
2 Tablespoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt


Directions
----------
1. Stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt
2. Add the milk, sour cream, oil, vanilla, and egg yolks. Stir until well-mixed
3. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks
4. Fold the egg whites in to the other ingredients; don't mix too much or you'll lose the fluffiness
5. Prepare a griddle to a medium-high temperature, and don't forget to butter it!
6. I like to use a pancake batter dispenser, but this batter is kind of thick so it might not work super well for you
7. Spoon (or dispense) pancakes that are about 3-4" in diameter. Whatever size you like!
8. Flip those pancakes when bubbles appear
9. Let them cook a little bit longer, and then serve them hot with butter and REAL maple syrup for best results


NOTE: You can skip the sour cream if you don't have it handy; also, adjust the amount of milk and sour cream to the consistency you prefer for your pancakes.
